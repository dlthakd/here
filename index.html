After a virtual event in 2020 and a scaled-down festival last year, the 75th Cannes film festival has announced a lineup packed full of previous Palme d’Or winners and festival favourites for what it hopes will be a return to full capacity – and maximum buzz.
<br><br>New films from Ruben Östlund, Hirokazu Kore-eda , Cristian Mungiu, Michel Hazanavicius and the Dardenne brothers – all of whom have already triumphed at the festival – will play in competition.
Meanwhile, Croisette favosurites such as David Cronenberg, Claire Denis, Park Chan-wook and James Gray will also vie for the prize.

<p style="margin-top:45px;">No British directors have so far been announced as having films which will play in either the official competition selection or the sidebars. But at least one film is set in the UK: Silent Twins, which stars Letitia Wright and Tamara Lawrance as June and Jennifer Gibbons, twins from the only Black family in a small town in Wales in the 1970s who are sent to Broadmoor after a crime spree.</p>
